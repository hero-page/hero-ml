# HeroML Documentation

HeroML (Hero Markup Language) is a novel approach for setting up multi-step workflows to interact with AI models like OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4. 

In this version, you can set up workflows in a series of steps, where each step is a prompt that the AI will respond to. The responses from previous steps can be used in the prompts for later steps.

## Install Hero CLI
### HeroML CLI Tool Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through the process of installing and using the HeroML CLI tool. 

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./path/to/file.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicty.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run /path/to/your/script.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 /path/to/your/script.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory /path/to/your/script.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json /path/to/your/script.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```

## Basic Workflow

Each workflow is a series of steps separated by the "->>>>" delimiter.

Example:

```
Prompt for step 1 

->>>> 

Prompt for step 2 

->>>> 

Prompt for step 3
```

## Dynamic Variables

In the first step, you can define dynamic variables in the format `{{variable_name}}`. These variables can be used in any step of the workflow. 

Example:

```
In a blog post about {{topic}}, include the following points: {{point_1}}, {{point_2}}, {{point_3}}
```


## Using Responses from Previous Steps

You can reference the response of a previous step in your current step's prompt using the format `{{step_X}}`, where X is the step number. 

Example:

```
What is the capital of {{country}}? 

->>>> 

Write a paragraph about the country: {{step_1}}
```

## Loop Action

There's only one action available in v0.0.1, which is "Loop". This action can be used to iterate over each item in an array from the response of a previous step.

In the first line of the prompt, write `ACTION: Loop`, followed by `ForEveryItemDoThis:` on the next line, and then the prompt. If you want each item in the loop to yield its own item in a UI list, you can add `ManyItems: TRUE` under the ACTION line.

Example:

```
ACTION: Loop
ManyItems: TRUE
ForEveryItemDoThis: Write a short bio for {{step_1}}
{{step_1}}
```


In the example above, `{{step_1}}` must be an array for the loop to work.

## Format of the Response

You must specify the format you expect the response to be in. For example, if you want the response to be an array of strings, you can specify "Return the list as an array of strings".

Example:

```
List the top 5 countries in terms of population. Return the list as an array of strings, like ["China", "India", "USA", "Indonesia", "Pakistan"]
```

## Important Notes

1. When using `{{step_X}}` in a loop action, make sure that `step_X` is indeed an array. If it's not, the loop action will fail.

2. You can only use variables defined in the first step (`{{variable_name}}`) throughout the entire workflow. New variables cannot be introduced in subsequent steps.

3. In the loop action, if `ManyItems: TRUE` is not specified, all responses will be added to one item. 

## Workflow Example

Here's an example of a workflow:

```
For a blog post about {{topic}}, 
I want you to return an array of strings, of keywords 
(both short & long-tail) that are related to the following points:
{{point_1}}, {{point_2}}, {{point_3}}.

->>>>

ACTION: Loop
ManyItems: TRUE
ForEveryItemDoThis: Regarding my blog post about {{topic}}, write a paragraph about:
{{step_1}}
```

In this workflow, the first step is a prompt asking the AI to write a blog post about a certain topic, including three points. The second step is a loop action that asks the AI to write a paragraph about each point. The result of the second step will be an array of paragraphs, each about one point from the first step.

# How to use HeroML Interpreter in your project

This guide will show you how to import and use the HeroML Interpreter in your own projects. 

## Importing the HeroML Interpreter

Firstly, you need to import the `main` function from the HeroML Interpreter. You can do this with the following line of code:

```javascript
import { main } from './compilers/node/compile';
```

Ensure that the path in the import statement correctly points to the location of the `compile.js` file in your project.

## Setting up the Initial Values

Before you can use the `main` function, you need to set up the initial values for your dynamic variables. These are the variables that will be used in your HeroML script.

Here's an example of how to set up the initial values:

```javascript
const initialValues = {
    blog_title: 'SEO Optimization: A short Guide',
    keywords: "SEO,",
    tone: 'informative',
    number_of_main_points: 1
};
```

In this example, we're setting up four variables: `blog_title`, `keywords`, `tone`, and `number_of_main_points`.

## Using the HeroML Interpreter

After setting up your initial values, you can now use the `main` function to interpret your HeroML script. You need to pass in two arguments to the `main` function:

1. The HeroML script as a string
2. The initial values you just set up

Here's an example of how to use the `main` function:

```javascript
const heroml = `Your HeroML script goes here`;

async function run() {
    try {
        const finalEnvironment = await main(heroml, initialValues);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

run();
```

In this example, we're wrapping the call to `main` inside an asynchronous function called `run`. This is because `main` returns a promise that resolves with the final environment â€” the output of the last step in the HeroML script. The `run` function is then called to initiate the interpretation process.

The response will be dependant on each step.
If `step_1` is a normal prompt, but `step_2` is a loop, of 3 items, it will look like:


```javascript
let finalEnvironment = {
  blog_title: 'SEO Optimization: A short Guide',
  keywords: 'SEO,',
  tone: 'informative',
  number_of_main_points: 1,
  step_1: '**Array of 3 objects**',
  step_2_1: '...',
  step_2_2: '...',
  step_2_3: '...',
}
```

To use your OpenAI API key, add:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

to your `.env` file, and make sure _not_ to push it up... like me.


## Compilation

### Typescript

To use the TypeScript compiler, run:

```bash
npx ts-node index.ts
```

### Python

I recommend making a virtual environment and sourcing it since the openai library has a lot of dependencies. If you don't understand what this means, don't worry about it; it's an optional step that doesn't make much of a difference.

```bash
cd compilers/py
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python compile.py ./../../examples/Colors.heroml
```

_If `python` doesn't work, try `python3`_

This is all there is to using the HeroML interpreter! You can now build your own applications using HeroML. Remember to replace `Your HeroML script goes here` with your actual HeroML script.

**Note:** If an error occurs during the interpretation process, it will be caught in the `catch` block and logged to the console.

# HeroML Extension for Visual Studio Code

Enjoy writing your HeroML workflows with syntax highlighting!


## Limitations

1. Only one action (`Loop`) is available in v0.0.1.

2. The responses from the AI are dependant on your own prompting. If you need a specific format (like an array of strings), you need to specify it in the prompt. I will make this easier in future versions.

3. The variables (`{{variable_name}}`) are static and must be defined in the first step. They cannot change throughout the workflow.

This documentation provides a basic overview of how to create and use workflows in HeroML v0.0.1. As the language evolves, new features and functionalities will be added. For the most up-to-date information, always refer to the latest documentation.

# Formatting Rules

## 1. Step Separation
Different steps in a HeroML script are separated by `->>>>`.

## 2. Numbering
Steps do not need to be numbered.

## 3. Addressing
You're not writing to the user, but rather to an AI model. When you include dynamic variables in the first step, the UI will already prompt the user to fill them in, and they will be replaced as if a natural part of the sentence.

## 4. Dynamic Variables
You can only create new custom dynamic variables in the first step. In any following steps, the dynamic variables are either from the first step (re-used to maintain context) or step variables, like `{{step_1}}`.

## 5. Referencing Steps
You can only reference previous steps. For example, after step 1 finishes running, in step 2, you can reference the output from step 1, like so: "Write something about `{{step_1}}`".

## 6. Modes
There are two modes in HeroML:
### a. Default Mode
The default mode, where no action is present, and it is a single prompt that yields a response.
### b. Loop Action
A loop action, denoted by:

```
ACTION: Loop
ManyItems: TRUE
ForEveryItemDoThis: for every item in this array, write 15 words:
{{step_2}}
```

## Using HeroML Instruction Flags

- Tutorial: Using HeroML Instruction Flags
  - Why use instruction flags?
  - How to use instruction flags?
  - Available Instructions
    - `--return-json-array-strings`
    - `--return-json-array-numbers`
    - `--return-json-array-boolean`
    - `--return-json-array-dates`
    - `--return-json-array-objects`
    - `--return-json-array-objects-two-keys`
    - `--return-json-array-objects-three-keys`
    - `--return-json-array-objects-mixed`
    - `--return-json-array-objects-nested`
    - `--return-json-array-objects-arrays`
    - `--return-json-array-mixed`


In HeroML, we often use AI prompts to direct our models in specific ways. We can ask the model to return responses that are JSON arrays, strings, numbers, or even more complex structures. To make this process more efficient, we have predefined certain instructions, called instruction flags, that you can insert into your prompts.

## Why use instruction flags?

Instruction flags help make the prompts to the AI more explicit, ensuring that the AI model returns the desired type of response. This is particularly useful when you're dealing with loop actions and need your responses in a specific format. For example, if you're trying to generate a list of items with specific properties, it's much easier to guide the AI by using an instruction flag.

## How to use instruction flags?

Using instruction flags is easy. You simply insert the flag into your prompt. For example:

```
Generate a list of random fruits --return-json-array-strings
```

When your prompt is parsed, the instruction flag `--return-json-array-strings` will be replaced with explicit instructions to the AI model, helping it understand exactly what you want.

Here's how different instruction flags work:

1. **--return-json-array-strings**: This flag instructs the AI to return a json array of strings as a plain text response. For example:

```
["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]
```
2. **--return-json-array-numbers**: This flag tells the AI to return a json array of numbers. For example:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

3. **--return-json-array-boolean**: This flag directs the AI to return a json array of boolean values. For example:

```
[true, false, true]
```

...and so on. Each instruction flag guides the AI in producing a different type of output. Using these flags helps you get the results you want more consistently and with less manual tweaking of the prompts.
